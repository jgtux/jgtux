# About Me

Iâ€™m a Data Science & AI student with practical experience in backend development, systems programming, and privacy-conscious technologies. I focus on building efficient, secure, and maintainable software by blending modern tools with time-tested programming principles.

## Experience

- Developed production-grade APIs in Go, such as integrating an external API to list movies playing in shopping mall cinemas and building a module for capturing consumer receipt information (NFC-e). 
- Maintained backend services in Node.js.  
- Created language model-based verifiers using sentence-transformers (e.g., `all-mpnet-base-v2`).  
- Built ClojureScript front-ends with a functional approach, including a UI for a university coursework project.  
- Developed automation tooling and system utilities in Python, Go, C, and shell scripting for Linux and BSD environments.
