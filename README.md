## About Me

I'm a Data Science & AI student with hands-on experience across backend development, front-end interfaces, and systems programming. I’m particularly passionate about UNIX-like operating systems, privacy-focused technologies, and the elegance of functional and structured programming.

I've worked on real-world projects that span the stack:

- Built production-ready APIs in Go
- Participated in maintenance of APIs in Node.js
- Developed a chatbot as part of a college subject using Python and PyMongo  
- Created ClojureScript front-ends with a functional approach to UI  
- Written systems utilities in C and shell scripts for Linux and BSD environments  

I enjoy building efficient, secure, and maintainable software—often blending modern tools with classical programming philosophies.
